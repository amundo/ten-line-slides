<div class="info">
 <p>(We’ll keep our accumulated CSS in the top right corner, up there ↑)</p>
 <p>Now, we want each slide (<code>section</code> tag) to be the full size of the
viewport, so we’ll set the width of each slide to <code>100vw</code> which means
“100 percent of the viewport width”, and <code>100vh</code>, “100% of the viewport
height.”
 <pre>
    section {  width: 100vw; height: 100vh; }
 </pre>
Of course, that’s going to mean that only one slide will fit on the screen, as you can
see in the <a href="7.html">next</a> slide.
